# FicusJS counter examples

Inspired by [Webcomponents.dev](https://webcomponents.dev/) [_All the Ways to Make a Web Component_](https://webcomponents.dev/blog/all-the-ways-to-make-a-web-component/),
this is a comparison of coding style, bundle size and performance of 4 different ways to make a Web Component with [FicusJS](https://github.com/ficusjs/ficusjs)!

## Summary

The same `<my-counter />` web component has been written 4 times in [FicusJS](https://github.com/ficusjs/ficusjs) using different renderers.

The renderers used are:

- Built-in element renderer
- [htm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htm)
- [htm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htm) with [Preact](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preact)
- [lit-html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit-html)
- [uhtml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uhtml)
